The project is Nutrition Recommendation System by AI.

The Project is conducted using the Food 101 Dataset. Because of the system limitation the Food - 25 dataset is used.

The Food - 25 Dataset is the first 25 food items or folders of the Food 101 dataset.

To run this code. Please follow the below steps.

1. Install the required libraries using 'pip install'. Libraries used here are Numpy, keras , Tensor Flow, Matplolib, Seaborn and Tkinter.
2. Download the Dataset from the link below, extract it, copy first 25 folders of the dataset and create a new folder 'Food - 25'.
3. The path to the dataset is already set. Incase if there is an error, pleaae check the path of the Dataset.
4. Download the CSV file provided here along with the 'ipynb' Files.
5. Run the Files name Xception and Inception ResNet V2. If the RAM is less on computer and running locally on VS Code. Please run these files one at at time as the training time will be large.
6. After the whole file is run at the last cell is the coding for the Desktop App.
7. Follow along the coding on that cell for App and write the specific messages.
8. Upload the image you want to check the nutritional components for.
